## Bio
I am an Adjunct Lecturer in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at BRAC University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from BRAC University and am pursuing a Master’s degree at the same institution (expected completion Jun 2026). Passionate about Computer Vision, AI and AI security, I combine expertise in machine learning and full-stack development to drive innovative solutions.

## Other Research Works
**Enhanced Hybrid Technique for Efficient Digitization of Handwritten Marksheets**  
*Co-Supervised*  
This project developed a hybrid approach combining image processing and machine learning to digitize handwritten marksheets efficiently. The method improves accuracy in extracting text and numerical data from scanned marksheets, addressing challenges like varied handwriting styles and noise.
